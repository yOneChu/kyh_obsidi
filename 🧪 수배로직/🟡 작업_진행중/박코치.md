Amania for learning English.

Listen as Chinese students practice their English by screaming it.

...change my life!

I want to change my life.

I don't want to let my parents down.

I don't want to let my parents down.

I don't ever want to let my country down.

I don't ever want to let my country down.

Most importantly...

I don't want to let myself down.

How many people are trying to learn English worldwide?

Two billion of them.

In Latin America, in India, in Southeast Asia, and most of all in China.

If you're a Chinese student, you start learning English in the third grade, by law.

That's why this year China will become the world's largest English-speaking country.
